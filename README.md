## Welcome to FastHTMLCups!

This is a FastHTML application hosted on HuggingFace that allows students to select colored cups and view their selections in real-time. The app demonstrates session management, real-time updates, and interactive UI components using FastHTML. Teachers can see all student selections live, while students can only see their own choices.

A link is provided on the student view to access the teacher's dashboard, in case they want to see what the teacher sees!
